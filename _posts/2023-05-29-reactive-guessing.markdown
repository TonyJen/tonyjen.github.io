Adaptive guessing, also known as adaptive estimation or adaptive prediction, is an approach that involves making educated guesses or predictions while continuously adjusting and refining them based on new information or feedback. This iterative process allows for improvement and adaptation over time.

Here's a general framework for adaptive guessing:

Gather initial information: Begin by collecting relevant data or information related to the problem or situation you're trying to make predictions about. This could include historical data, observations, expert opinions, or any available data sources.

Formulate an initial guess: Based on the available information, formulate an initial guess or prediction. This initial guess can be based on existing patterns, knowledge, or any logical reasoning.

Gather feedback: As new data or information becomes available, gather feedback to assess the accuracy of your initial guess. This feedback could come from direct observations, expert opinions, or comparisons against known outcomes.

Evaluate and update your guess: Compare the feedback with your initial guess and evaluate the level of accuracy. Use this evaluation to update and adjust your guess accordingly. If your initial guess was incorrect, consider the reasons for the discrepancy and make necessary adjustments.

Incorporate new information: Continuously monitor and incorporate new information into your estimation process. This could involve collecting additional data, conducting further research, or seeking expert advice to enhance your understanding of the problem and refine your guess.

Iterate and refine: Repeat the process of making a new guess, gathering feedback, evaluating, and updating based on the new information. Each iteration should lead to a more refined and accurate estimation.

Learn from errors: Analyze any errors or discrepancies between your predictions and the actual outcomes. Learn from these errors to identify potential biases, gaps in knowledge, or areas for improvement in your estimation process.

Continuously adapt: Adapt your estimation process based on the feedback and insights gained from previous iterations. Use this adaptation to refine your approach and make more accurate predictions over time.

Adaptive guessing requires a combination of critical thinking, data analysis, and learning from feedback to continuously improve your predictions. It is particularly useful in situations where the available information is limited, uncertain, or subject to change.
